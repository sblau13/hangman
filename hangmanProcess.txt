OBJECTIVE:

This program will allow the user to play hangman against the computer using a list of words from a txt file
-Function that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
-Function that takes input from the user whoch will be the letter guessed
-Function that will take the letters guessed correctly and turn them into a string
-Create various variables to store the users inputted data
    -Variable for the word that the computer picks
    -Create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed right by the user
-Display an intro to the program
-Repetitive system so that the user can keep guessing letters
-If user guesses wrong a new part of body is drawn until they lose (guesses left goes down/wrong guesses goes up)
-Add statements at the end and beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
